I am a post-doctoral researcher at Brown University, where I study human prefrontal cortex and the mental flexibility it supports.

I earned a Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience at Washington University in St. Louis. There, I studied how prefrontal cortex enables us to "override" habitual or automatic behaviors. To do this, I used highly controlled experiments, non-invasive neuroimaging methods (fMRI and EEG), and a range of computational modeling methods.

Before my Ph.D, I worked with stroke survivors at Johns Hopkins Neurology, studying their patterns of impariments in language production and in cognitive control.

My journey in neuroscience began at University of Wisconsin--Madison, where I first learned about working memory, visual attention, and the joys of studying the brain.

I am a post-doctoral researcher at Brown University, where I study human prefrontal cortex and the mental flexibility that it supports.

I recently earned a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from Washington University in St. Louis. There, I focused on studying how we are able to override habitual or "automatic" behaviors, using fMRI, EEG, and a range of computational and statistical modeling methods. Before that, I was a research tech in a Johns Hopkins Neurology lab, where I worked with individuals who had suffered strokes, examining their patterns of impairments in language production and cognitive control. And before that, I was an undergrad at University of Wisconsin--Madison, where I first learned about working memory, visual attention, and the joy of studying the brain.

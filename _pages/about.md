I am a post-doctoral researcher at Brown University, where I study human prefrontal cortex and the mental flexibility that it supports.

I've recently earned a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from Washington University in St. Louis. My research has focused on studying neural activity in human prefrontal cortex, measured non-invasively through fMRI and EEG recording methods while participants performed demanding tasks. A broad goal of this research was to understand how properties of this activity contribute to our distinctive capacity for flexible, non-habitual behavior.

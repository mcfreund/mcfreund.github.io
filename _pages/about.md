I am a post-doctoral researcher at Brown University, where I study human prefrontal cortex and the mental flexibility that it supports.

I've recently earned a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from Washington University in St. Louis, where I focused on studying how we are able to override habitual or ``automatic'' behaviors, using non-invasive fMRI, EEG and a range of statistical and computational modeling methods. Before that, I was a research tech in a Johns Hopkins Neurology lab, where I worked with individuals who had suffered strokes, studying their patterns of impairments in language production and cognitive control. And before that, I was an undergrad at University of Wisconsin--Madison, where I first learned about working memory, visual attention, and the joy of studying the brain.

Please feel free to [reach out to me](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/postdoc/michael-freund) with questions about my research, code, or data; to request my service in peer review; or just to connect!
